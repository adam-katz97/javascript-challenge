# javascript-challenge
This exercise was my first real attempt at mixing multiple elements of javascript together into one web page. It was rather confusing at times, trying to remeber what every command did and what could and could not be used together. Perhaps the biggest hurdle of all was the fact that I am still not entirely sure how I am able to display things on the webpage, but with help from my classmate i was able to get everything to work. I also learned that i was overthinking the filter aspect of the webpage, not realizing that once i had properly made the filter code, i could just copy the code for the data table into my filter function. Overall, I am hesitant to say that i truly know what i am doing in javascript, but i can at least get a servicible framework made.
